**The Embodied Agents Suite**

TEAS is a suite to train embodied agents across a variety of tasks, 
environments, simulators. TEAS defines an API through which users can train 
agents on existing embodied tasks as well as add new simulators, tasks. It 
also aims to make benchmarking of agents across environments and tasks easier
. The suite is also designed for training RL agents and will provide 
functionality for parallel execution of episodes.
